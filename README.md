# Simple-Banking-System
# Banking Management System (C++)

## Overview
This is a simple **Banking Management System** implemented in **C++** as part of a learning project to understand and apply the concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. The system provides a menu-driven program to perform basic banking operations.

## Features
- **Create an Account**: Add new customer accounts with name, account number, and initial balance.
- **Display All Accounts**: View details of all created accounts.
- **Search Account**: Search for a specific account using the account number.
- **Deposit Money**: Deposit an amount into a specific account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw an amount from a specific account.
- **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Concepts Used
- **Classes and Objects**: Encapsulation of account data.
- **Constructors**: Initialize account details during object creation.
- **Access Modifiers**: Private data members and public methods for secure access.
- **Vectors**: To store multiple accounts dynamically.
- **Modular Design**: Functions to handle specific tasks, ensuring code reusability and maintainability.

Future Improvements
-Add data persistence using file handling.
-Implement user authentication for added security.
-Enhance the menu interface with more intuitive options.
